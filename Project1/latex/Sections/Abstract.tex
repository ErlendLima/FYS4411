\begin{abstract}
A hard shell bosonic system in an elliptical harmonic oscillator investigated
using variational Monte Carlo, with and without importance sampling. The
variational parameter was optimized by gradient descent. Blocking is used to hinder underestimation of the
statistical error due to correlated data, as popularized by \cite{Blocking}. 

For $\beta = 2.82843$, $a = 0.0043$, the ground state energy was found to be
\(24.3985 \pm 0.0011\), \(127.37 \pm 0.035\) and \(265.69 \pm 0.27\), for 10, 50
and 100 bosons, respectively. Importance sampling was shown to be more efficient
than brute force sampling, in the sense that it created less correlated data and
converged faster to the physical solution. The one-body density was shown to widen for a increasing number of particles,
indicating that the hard shell potential behaves repulsively, as expected.
