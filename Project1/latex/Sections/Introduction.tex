\section{Introduction}

Attention has in recent years been given to confined quantum mechanical systems,
with the prospect of applications from qbits to energy storage. Among these
are bosonic systems, due to the discovery of Bose-Einstein condensates in gases
of alkali atoms~\cite{Nilsen2005}.\newline

Many-body systems are remarkably difficult to solve, rarely having any
analytical solution. Variational Monte-Carlo offers a numerical approach,
whereby parameters in a trial wave function are optimized to minimize the ground
state energy. This approach is explored on a system of hard-shell bosons bound by an
elliptical trap. The system is explored in several dimensions, differing number
of particles and variations of the potentials. The implementation is compared
to analytical results wherever possible, and its numerical results discussed.
