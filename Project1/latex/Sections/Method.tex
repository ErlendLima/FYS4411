\subsection{Gradient Descent}
Variational Monte Carlo involves varying the variational parameter \(\alpha\)
to find its optimal value. This is accomplished using gradient descent. The
iterative method updates its guess at \(\alpha\) by steeping in the direction of
the largest change in the local energy with respect to \(\alpha\)

\begin{align*}
  \alpha_{n+1} &= \alpha_{n} - \eta\pdv{E_{L}}{\alpha}\left( \alpha_{n} \right)
\end{align*}

As optimizing \(\alpha\) is comparatively simple, no more fancy a method is needed.
